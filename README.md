# Sleep Diagnosis Recommender - Backend

## Description
The **Sleep Diagnosis Recommender** backend is part of a full-stack web application designed to help users track their sleep patterns and receive personalized recommendations based on their input data. Built with **Node.js** and **Express**, this backend leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze daily sleep metrics and provide insights into sleep quality.

This backend serves as the central hub for processing data logged by users through the frontend application. It handles user authentication, data storage, and integrates machine learning models to predict sleep quality based on user input. 

### Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: For server-side logic.
- **Express**: For building RESTful APIs to facilitate communication with the frontend.
- **MongoDB**: For data storage and management of user sleep data.
- **Mongoose**: For object data modeling and schema definition.
- **Machine Learning**: Custom algorithms to analyze sleep data and generate predictions.

### Overview
The backend API provides endpoints for user authentication, data entry, and model training. It processes incoming requests from the frontend and returns predictions and recommendations based on the user's sleep metrics. 

### Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for users.
- **Data Management**: API endpoints for logging and retrieving user sleep data.
- **Model Training**: Functionality to train machine learning models on user data for better predictions.
- **Predictions**: Returns predicted sleep quality based on analyzed metrics.
- **Recommendations**: Provides tailored advice based on user responses regarding sleep-related issues.
